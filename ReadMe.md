The repository contains the core code for the article "Edge Learning Using a Fully Integrated Neuro-Inspired Memristor Chip". It includes four parts of code:

1. Code for the hardware platform, including the code running on the personal host computer and on the ARM core of the FPGA.
2. Code to demonstrate that the STELLAR architecture could overcome non-ideal device characteristics.
3. Code to verify the scalability of the STELLAR architecture for large networks.
4. Neural networks, weights, and datasets used in the incremental learning tasks as well as the self-collected dataset for the light-chasing car.
